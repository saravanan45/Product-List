# Project Description

An React application with basic routing and authentication concepts to list, add, update item details where we have 3 pages

1. /login
   - to login with username password
2. /list
   - user can see all list after login here
3. /add
   - Add or update an item

Here are some restrictions.

1. use localstorage to store all details
2. itemdetails format = [{"name":"Sample item 1", "price":201, "tax":true, "_id":1}]
3. in itemdetails array, id is auto generated number
4. in list page all items details are listed in a table where user can edit and delete items
5. there is an add button in item list page, using which user can goto add page where user can add and save new item.
6. user should be able to see list and add pages only after user logged in
7. when user directly goes to list page without login, it should take user to login page
8. if user tries to goto login page aeven after login, it should not display login page, it should immediately redirect to list page
9. there is a button to logout in list page
10. user can't add duplicated item names,
11. item names are not editable
12. clicking update button will take user to add page where user can see the details and update the item details
    This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
